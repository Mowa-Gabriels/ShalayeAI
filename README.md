"# ShalayeAI: Your Pocket Product Guru üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è" 

Ever squint at a product label and wonder what half those ingredients even are? ü§î ShalayeAI's got your back! Think of it as your super chill, AI-powered buddy who spills the tea on what you're about to eat, drink, or slather on.

What's the vibe?

We're all about making informed choices without needing a chemistry degree. Just snap a pic of that label, ask ShalayeAI what's up, and get a breakdown that's easy to digest (pun intended üòâ). Whether you're curious about potential allergens, health effects, or just want to know what you're putting in your body, ShalayeAI's here to, well, shalaye (that's Yoruba for "explain"!).

How does this magic happen? ‚ú®

Under the hood, ShalayeAI uses some pretty cool tech:

Wanna try it out? Here's the lowdown:

Grab your keys: You'll need API keys for Google's Gemini and Exa. Don't worry, the code shows you where to pop those in (using .env for extra secrecy üòâ).
Fire it up: Clone this repo and run the Streamlit app (streamlit run app.py).
Show us the label! Upload a picture of the product label or even use your camera right in the app.
Ask away: Type in your questions or pick from the handy suggestions.
Get the deets: ShalayeAI will break it all down for you in plain language.
Cool things you can ask:

"Analyze the ingredients and give me a simple breakdown."
"What are the potential health effects of these things?"
"Tell me if there are any common allergens in here."
"What are the good and not-so-good things about this product?"
